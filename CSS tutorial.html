    <h1>Tutorial for class</h1>
    <img src="images/meimg.png" alt="404">
    <p class="username">Hello</p>
    <p>Hi everyone, This is my html site that uses <em>CSS</em></p>
    <p>This is mainly a tutorial site on CSS to go along with the lesson.</p>
    <h2><hl>CSS Image editing</hl></h2>
    <p>As you may notice, My image does not have sharp edges, even though the file does. This is due to the size and border settings of CSS. Inside of your "head" section, put "&lt;style&gt;". Underneath put "img" text with curved brackets besides it. inside of the curved brackets put "width:" text, and then a number of your choice. Without spaces, put "px" next to your number to stand as the pixel count. For example 100px. That will set the size of your image and you can always use chrome source to get your numbers. Now for the curved borders, you stay inside the curved brackets, but make another line. Insted of putting width as your text, simply put "border-radius" and set that to a number of choice, still including the px behind it. if you want a circle, put the number for your border as half the number for your size.</p>
    <h2><hl>Custom rules with CSS</hl></h2>
    <p>now that we've covered size and image borders, let's go over custom code rules. You probably noticed the text was a different color, and that is due to my custom rule "hl" make a double space under your image settings and create any 2 letter text. After that, put another set of curved brackets. Inside of those brackets, put text that says "color:" and then choose from red, green, or blue! under that text (still in brackets,) put "font-style" and set it to normal. That is the end of code rule, so now if you put your two letter text in angles, as long as it's surrounding text it will transform that text into the color you chose. After you have completed that, make another line and put&lt;/style&gt; there you have it. A code rule, and a fancy new image style.</p>
    <h2><em>Conclusion</em></h2>
    <p>That was it for my CSS tutorial because thats where MY knowlage ends. If you know more, feel free to write your own .html code and share it to help others like this one does. Thank you for reading and I hope that I helped in some way. If you have any questions or you want to correct ME specificly, please feel free to contact my email,  kidcosplaymichael@gmail.com Thank you, and I hope to help you again sometime.</p>
